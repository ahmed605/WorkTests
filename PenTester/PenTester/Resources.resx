    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

The accuser was wavering. She wanted to go public, to tell the world about her claims that the Fox News mega-star Bill O\rquote Reilly ogled her at their workplace and suggestively called her \ldblquote hot chocolate.\rdblquote\par
But Perquita Burgess was afraid, her attorney Lisa Bloom said. Afraid of Twitter trolls and other haters. Afraid that a powerful man would ruin her life for daring to cross him. So, Bloom invoked civil rights history to say the words that finally persuaded Burgess, a former Fox temp worker who is African American.\par
\ldblquote Do you think Rosa Parks decided she was not going to do what she needed to do because people were going to say nasty things to her?\rdblquote  Bloom said, citing the heroine of the Montgomery bus boycott. \ldblquote This is \i your\i0  time.\rdblquote\par
She also explained to her client in stark terms what she hoped to accomplish: \ldblquote The mission was to bring down Bill O\rquote Reilly.\rdblquote\par
The accusations by Burgess \f1\emdash\f0  who first disclosed her claims anonymously through her attorney on Tuesday and has now publicly identified herself \f1\emdash\f0  added one more discordant note to a crescendo of scandal that has shaken America\rquote s most watched cable news network over the past year. At a moment when the conservative juggernaut might have been strutting with Republicans in the White House and firmly in control of Congress, the network is instead operating in an almost continuous cycle of bad publicity and damage control.\par
The {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bill-oreilly-is-officially-out-at-fox-news/2017/04/19/74ebdc94-2476-11e7-a1b3-faff0034e2de_story.html"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf1\cf1\ul departure Wednesday of O\rquote Reilly}}}}\f0\fs24 , Fox\rquote s biggest star, caps a bruising 10-month slog during which the network\rquote s all-powerful guiding light and chief executive officer, Roger Ailes, was forced to resign over multiple sexual-misconduct allegations, and some of its biggest names, including anchors Greta Van Susteren and Megyn Kelly, left to join competitors. The melodrama coincides with a generational shift in leadership as Rupert Murdoch\rquote s sons, Lachlan and James, assert more control over a lucrative channel that has played an outsize role in shaping the U.S. political landscape over the past two decades.\par
There could be more troubles ahead. In an interview Thursday, Nancy Erika Smith \f1\emdash\f0  the attorney who represented former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson in the legal claim that triggered Ailes\rquote s downfall \f1\emdash\f0  said she would file additional lawsuits next month.\par
O\rquote Reilly has called the claims against him unfounded and Fox has remained a ratings force. Even as the O\rquote Reilly accusations were {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/at-fox-news-a-wall-of-silence-surrounds-bill-oreilly/2017/04/06/266523ae-1ae0-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf1\cf1\ul prompting an advertiser boycott}}}}\f0\fs24 , his show remained atop the list of most-watched cable news programs. Still, the cavalcade of developments dampened morale among rank-and-file staffers, according to current and former Fox employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution or because of non-disclosure agreements.\par
Smith says it is hard for her to imagine a major culture shift at Fox; many key executives she described as \ldblquote enablers\rdblquote  of Ailes and others remain in top executive positions. A former staffer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed: \ldblquote Ailes and O\rquote Reilly might be gone, but the rest of the power structure is unchanged.\rdblquote\par
Fox executives are eager to counter the notion that nothing will change. Fox has brought on a new human resources director and all employees have now undergone \ldblquote sensitivity training,\rdblquote  company officials said. And the New York-based news operation has assigned a human resources employee to work out of its large Washington bureau.\par
Such moves could address workplace and financial concerns: Companies that spend large sums settling sexual-harassment complaints can draw the ire of shareholders. Ailes, who has denied wrongdoing, got a $40 million payout when he resigned, while O\rquote Reilly walked away with $25 million. Carlson settled her lawsuit for $20 million, and {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html"}}{\fldrslt{\ul\cf1\cf1\ul according to a New York Times investigation}}}}\f0\fs24 , O\rquote Reilly and 21st Century Fox have paid $13 million to settle complaints lodged by five women dating to 2002.\par
What became clear over the past 10 months is that the best way to attack a news company is by making news. Smith said she wrangled with attorneys for Ailes, who wanted to deal with Carlson\rquote s sexual-harassment allegations through a secret, non-public arbitration process. When her client refused and went public with her complaint that Ailes thwarted her career because she would not have sex with him, \ldblquote that opened the floodgates\rdblquote  for other accusers, Smith said. Within days, numerous women came forward with similar harassment claims. Smith says her firm alone was eventually contacted by nearly 30 women.\par
\ldblquote By bringing Fox into the light of day, we\rquote ve been able to show how secrecy hurts all of us,\rdblquote  Smith said.\par
The scandal took a toll inside the news organization.\par
\ldblquote There were a lot of mid-level staffers, especially women and minorities, who were \f1\emdash\f0  are \f1\emdash\f0  seriously considering leaving Fox,\rdblquote  a Fox News staffer said on Thursday as the newsroom was still absorbing O\rquote Reilly\rquote s departure.\par
In her pursuit of O\rquote Reilly, Bloom took a similar tack to the one used by Smith in her case against Ailes, pushing the story into the public realm as much as possible. Bloom \f1\emdash\f0  the daughter of famed publicity-savvy attorney Gloria Allred \f1\emdash\f0  gained enormous leverage when the Times published its blockbuster April 1 story about the O\rquote Reilly settlements. But she feared that interest would fade.\par
She needed to keep the buzz going. So she persuaded Wendy Walsh, a Los Angeles radio personality who had been a guest on O\rquote Reilly\rquote s show, to hold a news conference on April 3. There were two goals, Bloom said: keep the story alive, but also draw out more accusers.\par
A mediagenic psychologist with her own radio show, Walsh had no intention of suing, but did offer a compelling tale. She\rquote d made occassional appearances on Fox, but said O\rquote Reilly dangled the idea of making her a regular contributor, which would have substantially raised her national profile. After a dinner in Los Angeles, she said, O\rquote Reilly tried to lure her to his hotel room. She rebuffed him, she said, and not long thereafter, her opportunity to become a regular contributor evaporated. (An O\rquote Reilly representative would later call Walsh\rquote s story false.)\par
After Walsh\rquote s news conference, Bloom started hearing from other women \f1\emdash\f0  just as she had expected.\par
At this point, something unusual happened. The usually aggressive Fox public relations squad fell atypically mute on the O\rquote Reilly matter, issuing no statements in his defense. It was clear: O\rquote Reilly was on his own. He brought on his own spin team, including an old Clinton White House hand, Mark Fabiani.\par
But, in Bloom\rquote s estimation, he had made a big mistake.\par
On the day the Times story hit, Bloom says, O\rquote Reilly had handed her \ldblquote a beautiful, gift-wrapped present\rdblquote  in his public statement rebuffing the allegations. The statement said: \ldblquote Just like other prominent and controversial people, I\rquote m vulnerable to lawsuits from individuals who want me to pay them to avoid negative publicity.\rdblquote  But his statement rested part of his defense on a claim that no one had ever complained about him to the human resources department or called in to an \ldblquote anonymous hotline.\rdblquote\par
It was an \ldblquote aha\rdblquote  moment for Bloom. After consulting a company handbook she had acquired during a previous case, she determined that Walsh was eligible to call the hotline, even though she wasn\rquote t a full-time employee. Bloom was so excited about the idea that the catchy disco-era song \ldblquote HotLine\rdblquote  kept running through her head: \ldblquote Hotline, hotline, callin\rquote  on the hotline.\rdblquote\par
Bloom\rquote s staff videotaped Walsh\rquote s call to the hotline, and sent the lengthy recording \f1\emdash\f0  which included spates of time when she was left on hold \f1\emdash\f0  to Walsh\rquote s tech-savvy nephew. He edited it into a shorter version to share with the media, including the moment when the hotline operator asks Walsh to spell O\rquote Reilly\rquote s name. On April 5, Bloom posted the tape to her Facebook page.\par
So now an official complaint was on the record, in just the form O\rquote Reilly had deemed legitimate. On April 9, Fox\rquote s parent company announced it was bringing in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison \f1\emdash\f0  the same firm that looked into allegations against Ailes \f1\emdash\f0  to examine claims about O\rquote Reilly.\par
By April 11, as more and more sponsors pulled their ads from \ldblquote The O\rquote Reilly Factor,\rdblquote  the combative commentator announced his departure for what he called a long-planned vacation in Italy.\par
According to Bloom, the attorneys brought in by Fox\rquote s parent company seemed to be in a hurry to close the books.\par
\ldblquote They were very eager for everything to happen ASAP,\rdblquote  she said. \ldblquote They were the ones pressing us to go, go, go. By the end, I thought they were looking for a reason to fire him.\rdblquote\par
Still, she felt she needed more.\par
Enter Burgess, the reluctant witness. Bloom could tell she would require delicate handling. Walsh was used to being in the public eye. Burgess wasn\rquote t. In mid-April, Bloom flew to North Carolina for dinner with the former Fox News clerical worker who said she had been subjected to O\rquote Reilly\rquote s coarse comments.\par
She left the meal thinking Burgess was on board. But the next morning, Bloom says, Burgess called to say she\rquote d changed her mind. At that point the lawyer brought up her Rosa Parks example. She put the question to Burgess like this: \ldblquote You mean to tell me that because of Twitter trolls you\rquote re not going to stand up for what\rquote s right? Is that what you\rquote re telling me?\rdblquote\par
Burgess came around. For the time, she would remain anonymous\f1\emdash\f0 and, like Walsh, she had no intention of suing for damages. But, knowing that the attorneys conducting an internal inquiry would be alerted, she agreed to call the hotline to outline her complaint, which dates back to her short tenure at Fox in 2008. And, just as crucially, she okayed allowing Bloom to put out the news.\par
On April 18, Bloom sent out a headline-grabbing tweet: \ldblquote I represent a new woman who just phoned in a complaint of sexual and racial harassment against Bill O\rquote Reilly to the Fox News hotline.\rdblquote\par
Bloom booked a flight to New York in hopes of getting big play on the cable news shows. She got it, and O\rquote Reilly\rquote s camp seemed to notice.\par
That same day, the anchor\rquote s attorney, Marc Kasowitz, issued a statement about the still-cloaked Burgess allegation: \ldblquote It is outrageous that an allegation from an anonymous person about something that purportedly happened almost a decade ago is being treated as fact, especially where there is obviously an orchestrated campaign by activists and lawyers to destroy Mr. O\rquote Reilly and enrich themselves through publicity-driven donations.\rdblquote\par
Kasowitz said his client was being \ldblquote subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America.\rdblquote  Without revealing specifics, Kasowitz said his firm had \ldblquote uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O\rquote Reilly for political and financial reasons.\rdblquote\par
When Ailes came under scrutiny, several of the network\rquote s stars publicly came to his defense. It was a testament to his power but also to a reservoir of good will he\rquote d accumulated among some of Fox\rquote s stars. O\rquote Reilly, whose television persona was often caustic and snide, mounted as vigorous a defense as possible from his Italian vacation, deploying a professional spin doctor to attack Walsh\rquote s claims. But, within Fox, he was much less popular than Ailes and the network\rquote s big names mostly kept silent.\par
By Wednesday, 21st Century Fox was ready to make its move. O\rquote Reilly was out.\par
\ldblquote This was a major step, I feel, in the right direction,\rdblquote  a current staffer who spoke on condition of anonymity said. \ldblquote There is still a lot of systemic work that the network needs to do to ameliorate the situation.\rdblquote\par
Within hours, women were appearing on CNN to share their own stories about him. Former Fox personality Margaret Hoover said that while O\rquote Reilly \ldblquote never sexually harassed her\rdblquote  she still had \ldblquote some experiences where I\rquote m uncomfortable enough for me to know never to put myself in a position where I was alone with Bill.\rdblquote\par
Later, Kirsten Powers, a USA Today columnist and former Fox commentator who is now a CNN analyst, talked on air about the time O\rquote Reilly thanked her on air for her \ldblquote blonde-ness.\rdblquote  Feeling disrespected, Powers went directly to the top, complaining to Roger Ailes.\par
\ldblquote What am I going to do? I don\rquote t like him but he makes so much money,\rdblquote  Ailes told Powers, according to her account of the conversation. \ldblquote You know Bill, he likes to put up dirty pictures and ask pretty girls to talk about them.\rdblquote\par
\ldblquote I told the story I told because it says a lot about the culture,\rdblquote  Powers said in an interview Thursday. \ldblquote That even if you did everything right, meaning you complained all the way up the ladder, it didn\rquote t really make any difference.\rdblquote\par
